# Scene 3 - Team B's solution

## Scene 3.1 - curvature and osculating circles
- What's curvature and the meaning of osculating circles
    - Formulas

## Scene 3.2 - Rolling tangent theorem
- The significance and riggor of this theorem
- Intermidiate value theorem for it on rounded square
- Is 360 degrees necessary?
- Convexity necessary?
- Let's explore first!

## Scene 3.3 - solving for a quadratic
- All the circles are "inside" the circle =>
- Showing that quadratics are "trivial"

## Scene 3.4 - the half circle and inner shadow
- Rolling tangents explained on a half circle and quick revist to 2.4
- What does inner shadow mean and why do solutions have to be outside
    - Quick highlight back to the quadratic and showing it's inner shadow
- "Concavely monotone" => always has a shadow => "trivial" Why does this train of thought hold

## Scene 3.5 - Concave switching 
- What are inflection points and why do they matter here
- Explaining the proof (assuming +-infinity points)
- ++infinity end points and bounded functions

## Scene 3.6 - Application of concave switching on functions
- Graph of cubic, inflection point and inner shadows, tangent at inflection (the simple case!!)
- Why cubic has a solution always by this
- Tan becomes "trivial", sin also when looking at stationary points

## Scene 3.7 - Non convex closed curves
- Trying to apply the rolling tangent points and concave switching
- Why does it have to be less but not full?

## Scene 3.8 - Conclusion
- That should really be every case right?
