# Script 2 - Team A's solution

## Scene 2.1 - polynomials what are they?
- Explaining derivations of polynomials and solving polynomial equations
    - Simple animation on Newton's method

## Scene 2.2 - "points of origin" explained and the equation
- Where does the equation $(x_\alpha-x_A)\times f'(x_\alpha)-f(x_\alpha)+y_A = 0$ come from

## Scene 2.3 - function graphs
- Why does the quadratic perfectly match? => Discriminant equation
- Why does the cubic always have a solution? => segway to odd polynomials
- Odd polynomials solutions and $(n-1)ax_A^n$

## Scene 2.4 - circle and it's tangents
- What's the benefit of splitting the circle
- Relevance and meaning of this (Remember this for Team B!!)

## Scene 2.5 - trig functions
- Why sin might have infinite solutions (Taylor series ~ cubic)
- No Taylor series for tan :(
- Looks like a solution should exist but can we prove it

## Scene 2.6 - conclusion
- What we know for sure about polynomials
    - Limitations of this technique but it's really easy
