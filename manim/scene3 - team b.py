TODO:
#* Scene 3.1 - curvature and osculating circles
    #? Where they come from
        #= Formulas ?
    #? r ~ 1/k
    #? Voiceover (script 3.1)
#* Scene 3.2 - Rolling tangent theorem
    #? A tangent moving along side a circle
    #? Intermidiate value theorem for it on rounded square
    #? Is 360 degrees necessary?
    #? Convexity necessary?
    #? Voiceover (script 3.2)
#* Scene 3.3 - solving for a quadratic
    #? Graph w/ circles
    #? Showing that quadratics are "trivial"
    #? Voiceover (script 3.3)
#* Scene 3.4 - the half circle and inner shadow
    #? Rolling tangents explained on a half circle
    #? What does inner shadow mean ? => solutions outside it
        #= Quick highlight back to the quadratic and showing it's inner shadow
    #? "Concavely monotone" => always has a shadow => "trivial"
    #? Voiceover (script 3.4)
#* Scene 3.5 - Concave switching
    #? Show how the tangent at inflection point fixes the inner shadows by proof in the pdf
    #? Why is this relevant?
    #? Voiceover (script 3.5)
#* Scene 3.6 - Application of concave switching on functions
    #? Graph of cubic, inflextion point and inner shadows, tangent at inflection
    #? Why cubic has a solution always
    #? Sin, tan become "trivial"
    #? Voiceover (script 3.6)
#* Scene 3.7 - Non convex closed curves
    #? Trying to apply the rolling tangent points and concave switching
    #? Small possible shadow areas inside => guaranteed to be less
    #? Voiceover (script 3.7)
#* Scene 3.8 - Conclusion
    #? Covers all our bases?
    #? Voiceover (script 3.8)
